    "# An introduction to MetSim: Command line usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first interactive component to our tutorial!\n",
    "Now that we've got a handle on all things MetSim, let's actually _run_ it.\n",
    "Predominantly, MetSim was designed to be a command line tool run through a shell interface.\n",
    "Because we are in a Jupyter notebook we have to first discuss some technology related things to get set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter can run multiple _kernels_ which are the core programming languages or environments.\n",
    "In fact, Jupyter actually stands for [**Ju**lia](https://julialang.org/), [**Pyt**hon](https://www.python.org/), and [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/).\n",
    "Beyond this there are many community maintained kernels for almost any imaginable programming language.\n",
    "This includes some shells, such as [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).\n",
    "However, we will not be taking the route of installing a bash kernel, but will instead rely on _cell magic_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell magics are invoked with the `%` character. \n",
    "Some examples include `time`, `load`, and `who`. \n",
    "We can also use `%%bash` to invoke bash, rather than python, in a cell.\n",
    "Using the cell magic to invoke bash will allow us to switch cleanly bewtween bash and python.\n",
    "We will use bash to examine the inputs, as well as run MetSim itself.\n",
    "Then, we will use python do do some simple processing and visualization of the output.\n",
    "Following that, we will run MetSim from python itself and do some more advanced output processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try using the `%%bash` magick real quick."

    "Let's start by looking at it.\n",
    "We have named it `test.conf`, and it's sitting right here in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "In bash, you can view the contents of a file by invoking a program called `cat`.\n",

    "As you can see, the configuration file is relatively short, and mostly consists of setting variables.\n",
    "Notice however, that there are several sections delineated by `[section_name]` headers.\n",
    "This sort of file format is known as INI, and is relatively common for simple configurations.\n",
    "Also note that comments in the configuration file begin with `#` just like python.\n",
    "Let's dig into each of these sections separately.\n",

    "* `out_vars` - this list contains all of the variables which we wish to write to the output data. For a list of the available options see [this page of the documentation](https://metsim.readthedocs.io/en/develop/data.html#output-specifications)\n",
    "* `time_step` - this is the time step of the output (in minutes). There are some limiataions on what this is allowed to be. Of course, it can't be greater than 1440 (number of minutes in a day). But it also must be less than 360 (or 6 hours) for numerical reasons. We also should note that, while you can go down to output on the minute, it really doesn't make sense to set this lower than 30.\n",
    "* `start` - The start date of the simulation, given as `YYYY/MM/DD`\n",
    "* `stop` - The stop date of the simulation, given as `YYYY/MM/DD`\n",

    "* `domain` - The path to the domain file\n",
    "* `state` - The path to the state file\n",
    "* `out_dir` - The location to write the output to. This must exist before running.\n",
    "* `output_prefix` - The prefix that the output file(s) will get.\n",
    "* `forcing_fmt` - The format of the input forcings. This can be `netcdf`, `binary`, or `ascii`. We will discuss each of these later.\n",
